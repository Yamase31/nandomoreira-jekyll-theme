        <title>Reading Responses:</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading Response from Monday, April 18th, 2016:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This reading made me think that your position on global politics has to do with your position on the goodness of humans. I love the stag hunt example where 5 hungry men are in a forest chasing a deer and one of the men breaks off to catch a rabbit for himself, but jeopardises the larger hunt. If you believe that people are inherently good, and will not “jeopardise the hunt for themselves”, you will lean more towards Liberalist ideas. If you believe that people are inherently selfish, and will “jeopardise the hunt...</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Quiz Questions for Monday, April 18th, 2016:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are you a realist thinker, or a liberal thinker? Why?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the US truly believes that North Korea is a threat to its security, why doesn’t it do anything about it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quiz Questions for Tuesday, April 19th, 2016:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you think that if all countries adapted liberal foreign policy agenda, there would be no more war?

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the representative of the United States, the SOS should try to visit countries that are most critical to US interests and strengthen economic, military, and cultural ties and understanding with these countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ensure that the United States achieves balanced trade agreements and economic relationships with these countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does his/her best to use diplomatic ties to avoid conflict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t think that the Iran deal has worked out well and I think that the US is too powerful to be bullied by Iran when it comes to making deals. I think the next SOS...</description>

        <title>Student Responses</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thursday, April 21st, 2016&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grace in class said that she didn’t think that Obama was an internationalist and I disagree with her, I think that Obama is an internationalist. Reading the atlantic piece and from watching the news, I got the sense that Obama has a crazy travel schedule. While Goldberg was with Obama, Obama was on a crazy travel schedule that took him to Turkey, Malaysia, and Indonesia just to name a few countries. He was there for the sole reason of strengthening economic and political ties. He also spent the last six months working on the Trans-Pacific Partnership...</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thursday, April 21st, 2016&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/world/middleeast/obama-saudi-arabia-summit.html?hp&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;amp;module=first-column-region&amp;amp;region=top-news&amp;amp;WT.nav=top-news&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This article talks about Obama’s visit to Saudi Arabia today. He met with the prince of Saudi Arabia and the leaders of other gulf countries. The purpose of his visit was to reassure these countries that they had US support and that the US was committed to their security. The article said that a secondary objective was to discuss counter terrorism plans. I personally think that Obama’s primary objective was to gather support on a coalition that would participate in counter terrorism operations. I know that Obama feels that he is alone in fighting terrorism...</description>
