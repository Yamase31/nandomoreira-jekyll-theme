What are Block, inline-block & inline and when should you use them?

Block, inline-block, and inline are all different ways to place text, links, images, etc on your website. Lets run through all of them:

Block Elements:

Have left and right margins, but no top and bottom

No set width and height

Line break after each element

No HTML elements

Inline Elements:

Elements can be on the left and right

No set width and height

Have left and right margins, but no top and bottom

No line break

Tolerates HTML elements

Inline-block elements:

Elements can sit left and right

Height, width, top, and bottom margins are respected

Same line as adjacent content

The three all have their advantages and disadvantages:

Block elements are best for lists or menu bars because they display vertically and all look the same, so the user wouldn't be drawn to a specific block and can choose which element in the list they want to select.

Inline elements are best for when you're displaying information in a paragraph structured way where you want information to flow as if you're reading a paragraph. Therefore, someone can read it just like they would read a book. This is best for displaying general information. Another advantage is that you can place links and images right into your paragraph and you wonâ€™t disturb the user's flow of reading.

Inline-block elements are best for menu bars at the top of web pages. When a user is on a webpage, they will have a bar at the top with navigation tabs, images, or links to take them around the website. I personally love websites that have a nice menu bar at the top that is all the same size and looks all the same because it is very easy to read and it is easy to navigate when all the different sections of the website are laid out in this very easy to read way.
