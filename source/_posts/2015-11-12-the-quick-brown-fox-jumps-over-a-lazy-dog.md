Just as the breathalyser can test if someone was driving under the influence of alcohol, a new device dubbed the “textalyzer” could tell if someone was texting while driving. The way this device works is that someone's phone will be plugged into a laptop with special software on it. The software will go into the touch sensors that cover the area of the screen that the keyboard is on. If the phone has a physical keyboard, the software will go into the sensors under the keyboard. The software will go into the history of either keyboard strokes or touch screen movements to put together messages that were sent and then put timestamps on them. The way this is done, is that every phone stores its keyboard sensor movements in an array to be saved for an hour or so. The software will go into the phone and traverse the array that stores keyboard strokes the array contains metadata that contains timestamps. Due to privacy, the software will take out names that were in the text messages and won't touch any personal data in the phone.

This software will be implemented once someone has been convicted of texting and driving. Also, it may become mandatory in NY state that it be implemented in every accident to see if texting and driving could be a cause of the accident.

This software has come about due to the efforts of a group called Distracted Operators Risk Casualties. The son of its co-founder, Ben Lieberman, Evan Lieberman was killed in 2011 by a texting driver at the age of 19.

The software has been developed by a company called Cellebrite. Cellebrite is an Israeli company that has been rumored to have been the company that cracked the iphone of the San Bernardino shooter’s iphone.
