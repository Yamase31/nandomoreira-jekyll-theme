What is Responsive Design? What are best practices for Responsive Design?

Responsive web design is where your website will look as best at it can and function as well as it can depending on the device that it is being displayed on. This means that your site will look different and function different on mobile vs on a computer. It also means that you need a different version of your site to display depending on the device. Responsive web design can be done two different ways. The first is the less efficient, but more straightforward. That way is to design a website for a computer that works well with a computer and then design and website for mobile. Therefore, depending on what device you're using, your website will always work well. The pros of this method is that your website will always work well on each device and will always work and look the same. The cons are that you have to design two separate website and phones and computers come in all different shapes and sizes so your website will not look good on some of those devices. The Second way of implementing Responsive Design that I personally think is better and more efficient is to design one website that adapts to the screen size and device that it is being displayed on. This is accomplished by having your website recognise what size of screen it is being displayed on and if it is a computer or phone. Then, the website will format itself to fit perfectly on your screen. Also, it will recognise that it is on mobile and will scroll easily with your finger, where if it is on a laptop, it can scroll slower because of the easier scrolling on computers. The second way is definitely better in that you only need to code one website and it will look good on every device. I would say that best practices are using the size of the screen to format your site and change the scrolling ease according to the device.
