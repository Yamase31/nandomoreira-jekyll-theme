THINK LIKE A PROGRAMMER

Write about your research and what stuck out. Do you agree or disagree with anything in the readings? Will you use anything that you read about? How so?

I agree that it is the effort that counts and not the intelligence that is important. The same is true in sports, it is not the skill that is important, it is the effort that is important and that wins games. Nike has a great ad that talks about this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijTwZNUBhcI&feature=youtu.be .I also agree that programmers are good at working through confusion. If you have an error in your program, and you don't know what is causing it, you need to be able to figure out what is wrong in a analytical an organized way. You need to be able to go through the code in order and work out an issue individually and then start over at the beginning of your program and then go through it again until your program runs correctly. This is a very important skill for programmers to know, but also an important skill to know for solving problems during life. Programmers need to be able to take on new challenges easily and be able to change their mindset and approach if the individual's problem requires a new approach. I think that programmers are great at understanding what is going on. Obviously, they will know what is going on in their programs, but they have the curiosity and skills to figure out what is going on in other things as well, where it would be easier for a non programer to simply accept the fact that “it works” and not to ask questions. I also think that programmers are resilient. They will not give up until the job is done and their program works. If they run into a problem, they will break down that problem into lots of little problems and then solve those. I didn't find that I disagreed with anything that was said in any of the three articles. I will definitely use these things that I have read about. Some of the things, I feel like I already do a good job of. Such as not giving up, breaking down problems into smaller problems, and being organized and analytical. However, I think that I could do a better job of taking new mindsets and trying to solve problems different ways depending on what is the best way to solve the problem.
