  <p>Reading Response from Monday, April 18th, 2016:</p>
<p>This reading made me think that your position on global politics has to do with your position on the goodness of humans. I love the stag hunt example where 5 hungry men are in a forest chasing a deer and one of the men breaks off to catch a rabbit for himself, but jeopardises the larger hunt. If you believe that people are inherently good, and will not “jeopardise the hunt for themselves”, you will lean more towards Liberalist ideas. If you believe that people are inherently selfish, and will “jeopardise the hunt for themselves”, you will lean towards Realist ideas.</p>
<p>Reading Response for Tuesday, April 19th, 2016</p>
<p>This reading made me question how Liberalism was so successful following World War II. Germany took advantage of liberal countries that had open trade and had friendly outward relations with other countries. Having liberal ideas also encouraged countries to trust one another and to not build up a large army. Having small armies allowed Germany to easily move through some countries such as Poland and France. After the war, you would think that these countries would establish realist ideas where they didn’t want to work with other countries and to build up their armies, but they didn’t do this and were open to trade and liberal ideas which I find really interesting.</p>

<p>I love Obama’s reference that more people die from slipping and falling in bathtubs than from Terrorism in the United States. He made this comment after he was constantly pressured to talk about the Paris attacks and what he would do to stop terrorism. I completely agree with him in that people are always so worried about terrorist attacks in the United States when just a handful of people die every year from them and that they should be more worried about other day to day things that kill people on a regular basis. Obama wants to focus on Asia which is an emerging market and developing economy that the US should pay attention to and develop trading relationships and economic partnerships which I completely agree that he should focus on this other than on terrorism.</p>
<p>Monday, April 25th, 2016</p>
<p>I thought that it was very interesting how Obama decided what international conflict to involve the US in and what conflicts to stay away from. He viewed Crimea as a part of Ukraine that was always going to militarily vulnerable to the russians and valuable to the Russians and of no interest the the US. He also had this viewpoint on Syria. He saw no gain from the US going into Syria and saw only downsides for the Russians considering their weak economy and overextension. Obama knows that all empires have collapsed because they over expanded and does not want the same to happen with the US. Also, contrary to the beliefs of most americans, Obama wants Russia and China to be strong and that is also part of the reason why Obama does not take action in Crimea or the South China Sea. He sees these governments as a better alternative than having these countries collapsing and having a more unstable government. Before reading this article, I was annoyed that Obama did not take action and let America look weak, but now I see that his strategy was actually smart by letting these countries overexpand and self destruct their economies, allowing the US economy to prosper.</p>

<p>What does ISIS want?</p>
<p>I think that ISIS wants to establish a caliphate. This is where a religious leader has control of a country or land. ISIS wants to take over all of Iraq and Syria and set up a strictly extreme and ancient form of islam to be the governing law. This means that this land would not allow women to drive, non muslims would be persecuted, women must wear veils at all times, and there is not allowed to be any forms of technology. ISIS is part of the way of achieving this goal and already have a significant amount of land and are continuing to try to take over more land and recruiting more fighters to help them accomplish this.</p>
<p>Friday, April 29th, 2016</p>
<p>I thought one of the paragraphs in our reading was very interesting and I learned a lot in it. It said that the Islamic State, contrary to what many people believe, is very Islamic. Around the time of Muhammad, followers of Islam were very barbaric and over the time, most Muslims have adopted islam to be less barbaric and have modernized it. However, followers of the Islamic State follow the original word of Islam. Therefore, they are very islamic because they follow the original Koran and the original interpretations.</p>
<p>Monday, May 2nd, 2016</p>
<p>I found it very interesting to see the point of view of supporters of the Islamic State. They absolutely firmly believed in the Islamic State and all of the values that ISIS stands for. They took literal meaning from the Quran and saw all of the stoning and beheading as the way that things should be and the way that the Quran should be followed in its original form. Recently, I watched a vice video about the deradicalization of women and children who lived under Boko Haram in northern Nigeria. In the video, the deradicalization was going well because the women and children had only been briefly exposed to ancient islam and had had horrific experiences under Boko Haram. I firmly believe that this “deradicalization” strategy will not work for ISIS because of their beliefs that are firmly rooted in the Quran that I personally think cannot be changed.</p>

<p>It is crazy that the US was thinking of reuniting leaders of ISIS and of Al-Qaeda in the hopes of rescuing one man. One problem that the US military has is that they have to adhere to the emotions of the US public. They have to sacrifice their years of intelligence and operations just to attempt to save the life of one man. The US public is really the body that governs all things in the US government, including the military. While it is strategically unwise, the US public would rather see a man get saved then the safekeeping of military assets and intelligence. The US public sees with emotion and not with ration and that is the inherent flaw that will allow this to continue to happen.</p>

<p>After finishing Mr. Wood’s article, I am convinced that there is not one approach or one action that is going to destroy ISIS. You are going to have to attack every aspect of the Islamic State. This includes their land, money, recruitment, fighters, and ideology. If I was in charge of defeating the Islamic State, I would do the following. Land: I would empower the Kurds with weapons, training, and money. They are the only group that we are allied with that is in the communities around ISIS that have a chance of defeating them. Money: I would commision drone strikes to destroy the oil fields that ISIS controls and not pay ransoms. This would dissuade them from taking prisoners and end their income from oil. Recruitment and Ideology: I would set up local groups at mosques dissuading young men and women from joining ISIS. Fighters: I would send a few thousand troops to help the Kurds fight ISIS and to lead the fighting. Lastly, after ISIS was defeated, I would set up a new country called Kurdistan for the Kurds to live in. This would fill the power vacuum. This would also make Turkey happy because they would not have to deal with the Kurds who live in Turkey anymore.</p>
