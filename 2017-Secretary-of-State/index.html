  <p>As the representative of the United States, the SOS should try to visit countries that are most critical to US interests and strengthen economic, military, and cultural ties and understanding with these countries.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ensure that the United States achieves balanced trade agreements and economic relationships with these countries.</p>
<hr />
<p>Does his/her best to use diplomatic ties to avoid conflict.</p>
<hr />
<p>I don’t think that the Iran deal has worked out well and I think that the US is too powerful to be bullied by Iran when it comes to making deals. I think the next SOS needs to be a hard negotiator.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think that the US always needs to take action when it comes to foreign conflicts. As the most powerful and respected country on earth, we need to do our best to resolve conflicts that arise due to the humanitarian toll that they take. If we get involved, that might inspire other countries to get involved as well. Take Somalia for example. In Somalia, local warring militia chiefs were taking all of the humanitarian food aid for themselves and the US tried to stop that but didn’t do a good enough job and needed to stick with it until the end to resolve the problem.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think that staying away from Russia is a good idea. I think that Russia’s ambitious expansion plans will in the end, lead to the demise of Russia. Every great empire has collapsed because of overexpansion and if Russia wants part of Ukraine, let them have it, they will regret it later.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think that laying down the line as Obama did in Syria is a good idea. It is good to say, if you do this, I will react. The only issue though, is that you have to react and not bluff as Obama did which lost the US a tremendous amount of international respect.</p>
<hr />
<p>In China, the SOS needs to be careful. While China still has many problems, pollution being one of them, they are a up and coming country with a strong economy and the US should be careful in not letting them become too powerful. If their economy continues to develop at its current pace, US companies should be incentivised to start manufacturing of their products in the United States. In North Korea, the SOS should give North Korea an Ultimatum. Let international inspectors into your country to investigate concentration camps and to inspect your nuclear capabilities. If they refuse, impose a blockade on everything going in and out of North Korea. This will force North Korea into a war which the US will win and then we should allow South Korea into the North to unite Korea. It is better to take action now while North Korea doesn’t have nuclear capabilities, than to wait until they do which could lead to disastrous consequences for the US and the world.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the middle east, the US needs to establish a two state solution to ease the Israel/Palestine conflict. They need to wipe ISIS off the map and establish a nation called Kurdistan in the ISIS occupied land. They should split Iraq into ethnic groups and establish new countries around those ethnic lines. They need to remove Assad from power in Syria due to his crimes against humanity and establish a new democratic government. They should set up a temporary US government in Syria in the meantime to avoid a power vacuum that could be filled by ISIS.</p>
<hr />
<p>The US should strengthen its ties with its allies and make new ones. Currently, the US is a lone wolf when it comes to engaging in conflicts and having a ally along side us would not only help us militarily, but it would also help our image in that it wouldn’t be the US vs. a specific country, it would be an international coalition vs. a specific country.</p>
<hr />
<p>Republican:</p>
<p>Carly Fiorina</p>
<p>She has leadership skills and experience</p>
<pre><code>1995-1998: President of the consumer product sector of Lucent (a electrical engineering 
and development branch of AT&amp;T). She led this $19 billion dollar company to grow to 
a $38 billion company while adding 20,000 jobs and increased the stock 10 fold. 
CEO of HP from 1999-2005, HP is the world’s largest seller 
of personal computers. Among her extensive nonprofit work, Good360, a nonprofit 
that donates excess merchandise to charity has been ranked by forbes as 
one of the ten most efficient charities.
</code></pre>
<p>She knows how to negotiate and how to create deals and agreements.</p>
<pre><code>In 1996 she planned and led the IPO (initial public offering) for Lucent. 
They had a successful launch and raised $3 billion. 
In 2001, HP under Fiorina acquired PC maker Compaq for $25 billion, making 
HP the largest seller of personal computers.
</code></pre>
<p>She knows heads of state personally and has experience dealing with them.</p>
<pre><code>She has had business meetings with many foreign leaders including the 
Russians, Chinese, Jordanians, and Saudis.
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Democratic:</p>
<p>Joe Biden</p>
<p>Foreign Policy and Relation Skills</p>
<pre><code>Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 2001-2003,2007-2009. 
Biden meet with 150 leaders from nearly 60 countries and 
international organizations during his time on the committee.
</code></pre>
<p>Vice president</p>
<pre><code>Vice president 2008-2016
Led Obama’s Afghanistan Strategy in 2009
Oversaw Iraq 2009-2011
Oversaw the stimulus package in the recession in 2009
Campaigns for Obama
Oversaw the Violence Against Women Act 2013
He always gave his opinion to Obama and his staff and attends events 
that are not important enough for Obama but important enough to have a 
senior US official attend such as the world cup and olympics. Obama said 
that Biden was like the guy on the basketball team who does all the dribbling 
and then passes the ball to Obama to take the shot and does not show 
up on the point sheet.
</code></pre>
<p>He knows how the executive branch works and has connection within that branch</p>
<pre><code>He has been the Vice President for 8 years and has made many connections 
within the executive branch including Hillary Clinton who would most 
likely be his president if he were to become Secretary of State. He knows her personally 
and would be able to work well with her.
</code></pre>
